Dear friends and relatives, I have an unprecedented announcement for you all. Today has been the first day that I've bicycled on July twenty eighth in waterville maine. Now I know what you're thinking - but doesn't he do that every day? But I assure you today has been different. today I biked with a yellow helmet!

No but seriously I did have a good bike ride today. Went up and around Colby, back by Uncle Deans and summer street. It was a good ride and I pushed hard but my computer did not manage to record it. Total bummer! I can only be so pissed though because it is such a great tool to have around otherwise. Most of what I thought about besides biking was the street sweeper from last week. And then again about the meetup tonight. I am psyched for the meetup. I am not as psyched about the street sweeper but I've gotten over my initial anger with it. I was pretty angry for a day or so. But now I"m just resigned, and I see it as a good opportunity to again participate in the civic process. Who else is the street sweeping for besides myself and the others who live in this city? My plan is to research the road commissioner, see if he is contactable. If he is, I'll draft and send out an email detailing my concerns. If he's not, I'll redraft and send out an email to the executive assistant. That should be a good start and enough to get the conversation started. As I was coming inside after the ride I had the idea that should I be completely ignored and the situation not addressed, I could write a letter to the editor for the local papers. That would be a little more dramatic but might work to shed more light on the issue and initiate a response from the mayor's office. I'm not psyched about doing all this but it seems like a good exercise, good practice for other situations, and is something do to besides programming. I'm a little worried about the programming becoming too much of what I do and therefore losing sight of other goals like being a comp sci whiz. I suppose the application is more important than the theory when we are talking about jobs. And of course that is what I am chasing at the moment. I'm looking for a job. Hopefully I'll get to talk to Isaac at some point today, before the meetup, so I will have more information to bring to my strategies there. Strategies being finding a job, experience, group project. I think it was alright that I explained my background as being a scattered amamalgation to sam last week. My background really is that, and although I've just started getting serious with programming this last year, I've had it in mind for a long time and have played with it for a long time. It really is just like math. Well, it's reasonably close to math. Thank you Missus Carver! For teaching us programming principles while teaching us calculus and the rest of it. That education has treated me very well, and was by far the most valuable of all that I had in high school. For better or worse that was the situation. I'd like to say I had other stuff going on but I know and you know that everything else was mostly a joke. We were only going so fast as the slowest person could stumble, and that was not fast enough for most of us. So we got good grades, but were never really challenged in the way that life challenges people. Now I have an education I am proud of, have taught myself to learn most everything I want to learn, and am building a skill set which will hopefully be in demand for years to come. In one more year I will have things figured out pretty damn well. Hopefully by this fall I'll have some experience under my belt or about to go under my belt. Whatever the hell that means. 

In other news I am going into B pond probably tomorrow, and will be there probably till Sunday. I hope to get a good deal done during that time, but I'm not sure if I will finish everything I set out to do. Namely, building the septic tank, which could be a very nasty and shitty job. I will just have to remember to bring a pair of boots with me. If I can find them. 

xoxo
